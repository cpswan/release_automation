# 6.0.0
- Added ability to authenticate to the socket rendezvous, and made this the 
  default behaviour.
- Added ability to end-to-end encrypt all traffic via the socket rendezvous (
  SR), and made this the default behaviour. This provides a good general defense
  against compromise by man-in-the-middle attacks if the two ends are
  communicating via the SR. The encryption is implemented by exchanging a 
  symmetric key via an ephemeral encryption keypair generated by the client 
  for every session.
- Added ability to "ping" a daemon for info about it, including which 
  features the daemon supports.
- By default, sshnp now immediately drops into a prompt for clients that don't
  support sshnp.canRunShell(). `-x` flag allows the ssh command to be output 
  instead of executing ssh immediately.
- Renamed everything sshrvd and sshrv to srvd and srv respectively

  it keeps any locally stored data
