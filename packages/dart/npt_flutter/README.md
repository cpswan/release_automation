# NoPorts Desktop

This is the source code for the NoPorts Desktop application.
See [the website](https://noports.com) for more information, or its companion
[documentation site](https://docs.noports.com) for technical and usage
information.

## Getting Started

## Building From Source

Building from source is possible and will work with already activated atSigns.
However, without a valid API key, activating newly registered atSigns is not
possible. You can circumvent this by either:

- Downloading the app from the store
- Use the [at_activate binary](../sshnoports/README.md) to activate first, then
  load the generated .atkeys file into the app.
